# Doctor Landing Page (Static Site)

A concise, compliant landing page tailored for physicians. Ready to deploy on Vercel as a static site.

## Quick Start

1. **Download** this repository as a ZIP and extract it.
2. **Create a new GitHub repository** (public or private).
3. Commit/push all files in this folder to your repo's root (where `index.html` lives).
4. Go to **Vercel → Add New Project → Import GitHub Repo** and select this repository.
5. For a static site, Vercel will auto‑detect settings. No build step is needed.
6. Deploy. ✅

## Customization

- Update text in `index.html`.
- Colors and layout in `styles.css`.
- Your Outlook booking link is already wired to both CTA buttons.

## Notes

- No frameworks or build tools—so it's hard to break and easy to deploy.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, descriptive labels, large hit‑target CTAs.
- Compliance: kept language factual and informational with clear disclaimers.
